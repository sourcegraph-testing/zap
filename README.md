# :zap: zap [![GoDoc][doc-img]][doc] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov]

Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.

## Installation

`go get -u go.uber.org/zap`

Note that zap only supports the two most recent minor versions of Go.

## Quick Start

In contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the
`SugaredLogger`. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging
packages and includes both structured and `printf`-style APIs.

```go
logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
defer logger.Sync() // flushes buffer, if any
sugar := logger.Sugar()
sugar.Infow("failed to fetch URL",
  // Structured context as loosely typed key-value pairs.
  "url", url,
  "attempt", 3,
  "backoff", time.Second,
)
sugar.Infof("Failed to fetch URL: %s", url)
```

When performance and type safety are critical, use the `Logger`. It's even
faster than the `SugaredLogger` and allocates far less, but it only supports
structured logging.

```go
logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
defer logger.Sync()
logger.Info("failed to fetch URL",
  // Structured context as strongly typed Field values.
  zap.String("url", url),
  zap.Int("attempt", 3),
  zap.Duration("backoff", time.Second),
)
```

See the [documentation][doc] and [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more details.

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive
and make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Zap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and the base `Logger` strives to avoid serialization overhead
and allocations wherever possible. By building the high-level `SugaredLogger`
on that foundation, zap lets users *choose* when they need to count every
allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar, loosely typed API.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more performant
than comparable structured logging packages &mdash; it's also faster than the
standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt.<sup

Log a message and 10 fields:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap | 862 ns/op | +0% | 5 allocs/op
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 1250 ns/op | +45% | 11 allocs/op
| zerolog | 4021 ns/op | +366% | 76 allocs/op
| go-kit | 4542 ns/op | +427% | 105 allocs/op
| apex/log | 26785 ns/op | +3007% | 115 allocs/op
| logrus | 29501 ns/op | +3322% | 125 allocs/op
| log15 | 29906 ns/op | +3369% | 122 allocs/op

Log a message with a logger that already has 10 fields of context:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap | 126 ns/op | +0% | 0 allocs/op
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 187 ns/op | +48% | 2 allocs/op
| zerolog | 88 ns/op | -30% | 0 allocs/op
| go-kit | 5087 ns/op | +3937% | 103 allocs/op
| log15 | 18548 ns/op | +14621% | 73 allocs/op
| apex/log | 26012 ns/op | +20544% | 104 allocs/op
| logrus | 27236 ns/op | +21516% | 113 allocs/op

Log a static string, without any context or `printf`-style templating:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap | 118 ns/op | +0% | 0 allocs/op
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 191 ns/op | +62% | 2 allocs/op
| zerolog | 93 ns/op | -21% | 0 allocs/op
| go-kit | 280 ns/op | +137% | 11 allocs/op
| standard library | 499 ns/op | +323% | 2 allocs/op
| apex/log | 1990 ns/op | +1586% | 10 allocs/op
| logrus | 3129 ns/op | +2552% | 24 allocs/op
| log15 | 3887 ns/op | +3194% | 23 allocs/op

## Development Status: Stable

All APIs are finalized, and no breaking changes will be made in the 1.x series
of releases. Users of semver-aware dependency management systems should pin
zap to `^1`.

## 🚲 Bicycle Advocacy 🚲

We believe that cycling is one of the most powerful tools we have for building healthier communities, reducing carbon emissions, and reclaiming our streets.

### Why Bicycles Matter

- **Climate action** — A bicycle produces zero direct emissions. Replacing even one car trip per day with a bike ride can save hundreds of kilograms of CO₂ per year.
- **Healthier cities** — Cycling reduces traffic congestion, improves air quality, and lowers noise pollution, making urban spaces more liveable for everyone.
- **Personal health** — Regular cycling improves cardiovascular fitness, mental well-being, and longevity.
- **Equity & access** — Bicycles are affordable, require no fuel, and open up mobility to people who cannot drive or afford a car.
- **Economic benefits** — Cyclists spend more at local businesses per kilometre travelled than motorists.

### How You Can Help

1. **Ride when you can.** Every trip made by bike instead of car counts.
2. **Advocate locally.** Attend city council meetings and support protected bike lane proposals.
3. **Be visible.** Use lights, wear bright clothing, and ride predictably.
4. **Welcome newcomers.** Offer to do a group ride with someone new to cycling.
5. **Support bike-friendly businesses.** Patronise shops that provide bike parking and commuter facilities.
